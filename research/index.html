<p>
My research interests, which are within the general area of fluid mechanics 
(classical and non-classical) and applied mathematics, encompass 
theoretical, numerical
and experimental aspects of transition from laminar to turbulent flows,
turbulence, optimal and robust control applied to fluid mechanics, premixed
laminar combustion, optimization techniques, possible chaotic behaviors in
flight mechanics and mathematical biology.

Fluid dynamic instabilities and generation of turbulence
</p>
</div>

<p>
The majority of the research works here described are centered on flow 
stability and transition to turbulence.
To have an idea of what this is, look at the picture above.
It shows a flow visualization, that is a way to make visible to our eyes what
happens inside the fluid.
If you are curious enough, you might wander how this fluid undergoes 
different stages  from a "regular" motion to "complicated" eddies. 
The answer is <i>we  do not know exactly</i>.
Hence, my interest in fluid dynamic instabilities and  transition to turbulence.
</p>

<p>
Other fields of research, still within classical fluid mechanics, are 
chaos theory applied to airplane spin motion, stability of thin liquid films,
flow control and optimization techniques.
More recently I got involved also in the study of 
the Madelung fluid and in the numerical solution of
the nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation of cubic type, which
naturally arises from the stochastic quantization of a dilute system 
of N identical interacting Bose particles.
As a consequence of my teaching duties, I have also approached the study of 
population dynamics and the interesting problem of spatial segregation in 
strongly-competing reaction-diffusion systems.

<h2>Quantum fluid dynamics and vortex reconnections</h2>
<p>
Vortex reconnections, stemming from randomized velocity fields, play a pivotal
role in the energy cascade, contribute to intricate mixing at small scales, and
augment diffusion effects. These interactions also serve as the primary
mechanism behind the generation of jet noise. If we interpret the axes of
tubular vortex structures as turbulence's underlying framework, the entanglement
of these axes signifies the topology of turbulence. Crucially, vortex
reconnections alter this topology. This
conceptual framework transforms into tangible reality when we shift from
conventional viscous fluids to quantum fluids like superfluid liquid helium
and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. 
</p>

<p>
In these quantum systems,
rotational motion is confined to vortex lines with fixed circulation due to the
constraints of quantum mechanics. Reconnections of individual quantum vortex
lines manifest as discrete, striking events, which have been observed
in both experimental and numerical settings. 
These events are fundamental for comprehending quantum
turbulence, a disorderly state of vortex lines induced by stirring liquid helium
and atomic condensates. In contrast, reconnections in classical viscous fluids
are not complete occurrences; classical vorticity is continuous, leading to
segments of initial vortical tubes being left behind as vortex threads. These
threads then undergo successive reconnections in a cascade and mixing sequence
as newly formed vortex connections recoil due to self-advection. Additionally,
classical reconnections entail dissipative events where viscous forces convert
some fluid energy into heat. Conversely, in superfluids, which possess zero
viscosity, the fluid's total energy remains conserved. It can be contended that
due to the inherent simplicity of quantum vortices (zero viscosity, fixed
circulation, small core size), quantum vortex reconnections hold significance
not only in low-temperature and atomic physics but also contribute to our
broader comprehension of fluid phenomena, serving as illustrative models for
Euler dynamics.

<h2>Boundary-layer receptivity</h2>
<p>
In the study of  viscous, boundary-layer instability, Tollmien-Schlichting
waves are typically considered. 
The term receptivity is used to define the mechanism through which a generic 
disturbance present in the external flow or at the wall
enters in the boundary layer and produces a wave. 
The latter can be stable or unstable.
When its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, however, transition from 
laminar to turbulent motion is observed.
On the wing of an aircraft, or on the blades of a turbine, it is convenient
to delay this transition so as to reduce the aerodynamic drag and to
save in terms of boarded fuel, or to obtain a larger turbine efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Methods used until today for transition prediction do not consider
the effects of disturbances present in the free stream.
On the contrary, receptivity calculations have proved that they can be 
important and should, therefore, be considered. 
The applications of the receptivity analysis to the aerodynamic design of 
airplane wings or turbine blades are hence of remarkable interest.
</p>

<p>
From the theoretical point of view, the problem is solved using perturbation
methods such as <i>Multiple Scales</i>.
Non parallel effects due to the boundary layer growth are therefore taken into
account and the introduction of the non homogeneous version of the multiple
scales allows their used for a receptivity approach.
The technique, coupled with the solution of the adjoint equations, 
computed the sensitivity of the solution to the external, exciting disturbances.
</p>

<p> 
Certain coupling behaviors are particularly interesting.
Some of them are 
the interaction between an acoustic wave and the wall roughness,
the interaction between a vorticity wave and the wall roughness, 
the interaction between wall vibration of the wall roughness, and
the interaction between a vorticity wave and an acoustic wave, both present 
in the external flow. 
</p>

<p>
From the result obtained up to now, it is observed that an external perturbation
(acoustic or vorticity wave, vibration of the wall, etc.),
can induce an unstable wave in the boundary layer only if coupled to a
fast adaptation of the boundary layer.
This can be achieved, for example, in the zone of the leading edge (as a
consequence of the boundary layer growth)or in presence of wall roughness, 
blowing/suction at the wall, temperature gradient at the wall.

<h2>Flow control</h2>

<p>
In the case of the Blasius boundary layer it is by now accepted that more than
one route to transition is possible.
When free-stream disturbances are very small, transition is conceivably 
preceded by the exponential amplification of Tollmien-Schlichting
waves.  
On the other hand, when somewhat larger perturbations are present, the near-wall
region becomes populated by elongated streaks of low and high
streamwise velocity.  
</p>

<p>
Early theory was able to explain the presence of the
streaks on the basis of a physical argument, named the lift-up effect.
Today, most attention has shifted to the fact that the
linearized operator governing the amplification of infinitesimal disturbances
is highly non-normal and, as a consequence, significant transient amplification
of non-modal disturbances can occur even in subcritical flow configurations. 
</p>

<p>
It is reasonable to argue that
transition can be spatially delayed if the amplification
of the streaks is reduced.
A simple way to do that is to employ suction/blowing at the wall
to control the growth of the streaks.
The term  <i>optimal control</i> is here used to denote the best way of 
controlling a certain initial perturbation.
In the context of boundary-layer instabilities, the perturbation kinetic energy
is usually taken as an indicator of the level of disturbances, so that the
control can be optimized by
requiring, for instance, the energy at the end of the flat plate (or
the integral of the energy over the streamwise length) to be the
lowest.
</p>

<p>
The simplest approach to identifying the optimal control of a given flow is to
impose the worst initial condition and then optimize the control. 
This procedure is indeed generally known by the name of "optimal control".
</p>


<p>
Another interesting topic related to flow control is the determination 
of the linear response of a turbulent system to small-enough  perturbations.
In view of the flow-control possibilities offered by modern MEMS technology, in
fact, the linear-response function can help considerably in controller design,
by answering such a basic question as which effects are to be
felt <i>here and now</i> if a wall actuator has been moved 
<i>there and a given time ago</i>.
Even though a turbulent flow is a nonlinear phenomenon,
a linear response either in the frequency or the time
domain can be defined if perturbations are small enough.
Using the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) tools nowadays available it is 
possible to describe the complete mean response of a turbulent channel
flow to small external disturbances. 
Space-time impulsive perturbations can be applied at one channel
wall, and the linear response describes their mean effect on the flow field 
as a function of spatial and temporal separations. 
The turbulent response is shown to differ from the response of a laminar flow
with the turbulent mean velocity profile as the base flow.

<h2>Optimal Perturbations</h2>

<p>
Classical hydrodynamic linear stability theory is based on an eigenvalue (normal
mode) analysis of the linearized equations of motion, (including the continuity
equation) and centers on the characteristics of the fastest growing normal mode.
A flow is said unstable if there exists a normal mode with a positive growth
rate for the given mean conditions. 
Nonlinear effects will either instigate a
transition of the flow to disorganized turbulence or allow the perturbation to
modify the mean flow enough to generate an equilibrium secondary state, which
can undergo a further, second instability and successive breakdown to
turbulence. 
</p>

<p>
Recently, nonmodal perturbations have been shown to have the
potential for large transient energy growth compared to normal modes for a
variety of mean flows. 
The nonmodal stability analysis is based on the fact that
for most flows the linear stability equations are not selfadjoint (the
eigenfunctions are not orthogonal). 
We can consider expanding an arbitrary
initial perturbation of unit energy using the normalized eigenfunctions as a
basis set. 
Because the basis set is not orthonormal, we will in general have an
initial cancellation of contributions between certain combinations of
eigenfunctions. 
However, because the contributions from the different
eigenfunctions grow or decay at different rates and have different phase
velocities, the initial cancellation of the contributions from nearly parallel
eigenfunctions will be removed as space (or time) increases. 
This could (and typically does) allow transient growth in the energy of the 
perturbation. 
Transient growth can occur in subcritical conditions for which no eigenvalue has
a positive growth rate. 
In supercritical conditions, this transient growth can
greatly exceed the exponential growth of the unstable normal mode over a finite
time interval. 
</p>

<p>
Optimal perturbations provide an upper bound for this energy growth, as they 
are defined as the the initial conditions for the boundary layer equautions, 
that cause the highest energy growth (from which the term "optimal"). 
These initial conditions are optimal in the sense that at the end of any
chosen space (or time) domain, no other perturbation will achieve a larger
increase in energy density.

<h2>Crossflow instability</h2>

<p>
The interest in swept wings for high-speed applications is due to the fact that
in supersonic regimes a bow shock-wave originates in front of "regular" wings,
i.e. straight wings with rounded-nose airfoil, leading to an area of very high
pressure just ahead of the leading edge. This dramatically increases the drag
and hence the fuel consumption. If the wing is swept backwards, however, the
pressure drop across the shock wave is reduced and so is the wave drag. When the
sweep is large enough so that the leading edge is completely contained within
the so-called Mach angle, the flow in front of the leading edge itself is
subsonic and the shock wave cannot originate. This eliminates completely the
wave drag. Besides wave-drag reduction/elimination, other advantages of swept
wings are the reduction of sonic-boom effects in supersonic flight and the
increase of critical Mach number in transonic flight.  
</p>

<p>
If wave drag can be reduced or totally eliminated by sweeping the wing, a more
difficult-to-control source of drag is skin-friction due to viscous effects,
which take place inside the boundary layer. This type of drag is directly
related to laminar-to-turbulent boundary-layer transition, which in high
Mach-number regimes affects not only drag but also heat loads because of mixing
enhancement, typical of turbulent flows. Allowing laminar flow over most of the
wing of a modern airplane, therefore, would result in remarkable engineering
benefits. This is the reason why transition to turbulence in boundary layers has
received a considerable attention over the past decades.  
</p>

<p>
From the point of view of practical applications, the understanding of basic
transition mechanisms will allow us to employ flow control strategies in order
to delay or avoid turbulence. Among these, passive ones would probably be
preferable since they are more easily realizable and, in general, require less
complications and less maintenance compared to active flow strategies.   
</p>

<p>
Despite considerable efforts, the physics of transition in high-speed boundary
layers are still poorly understood, in part due to the lack of experiments. By
presenting some results in supersonic swept-wing flows, the present study aims
at proposing infrared thermography as a technique to easier this type of
investigations.  
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the state-of-the-art infrared equipment available today, greater 
success and improved resolution of details of various flow
phenomena have become possible in the last years. 
Since modern infrared cameras
are able to measure temperature difference with an accuracy of nearly a tenth 
of a degree over
a small area, infrared thermography (IRT) represents a very powerful tool to 
visualize flow phenomena
that create measurable temperature changes on the model, such as shock waves,
flow separation and laminar-to-turbulent boundary-layer transition. 
</p>

<p>
The basic principle behind the use of IRT for transition-detection is the
difference in the convective heat-transfer coefficients between laminar and
turbulent flows. 
The laminar boundary layer allows very low heat exchanges
between the model surface and the surrounding freestream flow. 
Laminar regions
are thus characterized by a very low convective heat-transfer coefficient and
behave as an insulator when compared with turbulent regions. In practice, this
means that the surface in presence of laminar flow has the tendency to keep its
initial temperature, which, in general, is different from the temperature of the
external flow. 
On the contrary, the turbulent boundary layer features high
mixing and therefore high convective heat exchange. As a direct consequence, a
surface characterized by a turbulent boundary layer will reach the temperature
of the surrounding, incoming flow faster than a laminar boundary layer. 
</p>


<p>
IRT can offer several advantages compared to the other quantitative techniques
previously presented. 
The set-up and the necessary acquisition system is very
simple and compact. 
There is no need to paint or spray polymers, liquids or
other substances on the model surface before each run and external light sources
(like UV or others) are not necessary. Moreover, the user is not required to
perform any calibration, being done and certified directly by the vendor. Like
TSP, IRT can be used as a quantitative measurement technique or qualitative flow
visualization tool. It provides a global flow-field image without the necessity
of multiple local measurements (contrary to thermocouples) and if local
information is needed, data can be retrieved from the whole image using the
post-processing software that comes with the most common IR cameras used for
scientific purposes. Besides all these advantages, IRT is perhaps the least
intrusive technique because it does not require any kind of modification or
interaction with the model or the flow, which could alter the phenomenon under
investigation. This is preferable when transition is studied because of its
extreme sensitivity to environmental disturbances via receptivity. 
In some cases, if a better image contrast is needed, the model can be
heated or cooled with respect to its natural temperature, making IRT more
intrusive. In general, however, IRT is a very poorly intrusive technique.

<h2>Thin-films stability</h2>

<p>
Formation of superficial waves is observed during the wire coating process,
which aims at
covering a small-radius cylinder with a thin layer of another
material, initially liquid, so as to protect or paint textile
fibers, optical fibers, electric wires, etc.
The presence of these waves can have consequences on aesthetic finish or 
on the characteristics
of the product (i.e. thermal exchange coefficient because the surface increases).
</p>

<p>
In order to understand the way in which these instabilities occur, experimental
tests are carried out measuring the thickness of the liquid that covers
the wire before its drying, and deducing amplitude and characteristic wavelength
of the superficial wave. 
This measurements are obtained through a new technique
based on laser plane probes.
The use of two equal probes allows the experimental
measurement of the wave velocity and the amplification (or damping) factor
from the same wave. 
</p>

<p>
In the case of simple withdrawal of the wire from the liquid bath, or when 
an orifice is used for controlling the final thickness (die coating ), 
the obtained results agree with the existing theories found in literature. 
If an annular jet is used to control the final thickness of the coating 
(annular jet wiping), no existing theories can be applied for comparison.
A new model is therefore developed, which reveals very good agreement with 
experimental data. 
For certain ranges of the dragging wire velocity and
for certain values of jet pressure, the formation of waves is observed,
while in other cases this can be controlled or even eliminated.

<h2>Airplane spin</h2>

<p>
Can the spin of an airplane be considered a chaotic motion?
The origin of such a doubt 
resides in the fact that in certain cases the spin motion turns out to be very 
complex (the so-called anomalous spin) and the recovery of the aircraft is
very difficult or even not possible. Moreover, since it happens at angles 
of attack for which nonlinear effects are important, the spin could 
introduce chaotic aspects. 
</p>

<p>
In order to find an answer, wind tunnel tests are
carried out on a model of a fighter aircraft attached to its center of gravity
through an universal joint that allows only the three rotations. 
The angles that define the three degrees of freedom are analyzed using the 
typical tools of the theory of the chaos, such as power spectra, projections of 
the attractor in the phase space, reconstruction in the embedding space and 
Poincare sections.
</p>

<p>
From the analysis of the data, it can be deduced that increasing the wind
tunnel velocity, i.e. the Reynolds number, successive bifurcations in the 
frequencies of the motion, a more complex structure of the attractor with 
fractal aspects and sensitivity to initial conditions are found. 
These hints could make one think about an evolution
towards chaos, however true chaotic motion is not fully observed.
</p>

<p>
Other configurations are also analyzed, by changing the nose of the model or 
the wings, so as to verify the influence of these particulars on the motion. 
The conclusion is that, for certain configurations, a development of the motion
towards chaos is observed; for others the motion turns out be very regular.
Visualizations with smoke confirm the hypotheses concerning the aerodynamic
interaction between the wings and the vortices produced from the nose and
between the tail-planes and the wake due to the wings.
