<h2>09 Aug 2023. Page moved and responsive web features added</h2>
<p>
The last restyling of my web page dated back to 2005, when Internet navigation
was always on desktops.
That version was not suited to today's portable devices and, thus, I had
to introduce the minimum features of responsive web design by copying from from
the many examples available at 
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>.
I hope that my pages now render satisfactory well on a variety of devices and 
window, from minimum to maximum display size.
If not, please <a href="./../">let me know</a>
</p>

<p>
I also took the chace to move my webpage to 
<a href="https://zucchers.github.io/" target="_blank">https://zucchers.github.io/</a>
</p>

<h2>01 Nov 2008. Programming restored</h2>
<p>
I have recently written a script for Octave called 
<a href="./../gps/">Gps</a> to easier the generation of nice figures with
arrows, labels and various Gnuplot features, which are particularly useful when
making postscript figures.
I thought it was worth to share.
Have a look <a href="./../gps/">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>20 Sep 2008. Programming removed</h2>
<p>
I have removed the link to programming from the menu 
because I thought it was not useful (and things were quite obsolete there).
It might come back in the future.
</p>

<h2>01 Sep 2008. Book published</h2>
<p>
Almost by chance I have written a book together with Marco Squassina on the
qualitative study of ordinary differential equations.
It deals with discrete and continuous equations and systems of equations.
However, a quite large part of the book is concerned with non-linear 
planar systems, including chaotic behaviors.
It is in Italian, but there is plenty of figures  :-) <br>

<h2>28 Oct 2007. Search added</h2>
<p>
I added a Google search box within the webpage so as to easier the search for
information.

<h2>18 Oct 2007. A new picture</h2>
<p>
Many friends told me that the picture on the top-right corner was a little
scary.
I spent sometime looking for something more appropriate (and less scary) and I 
finally ended up with
this one, taken in the summer 2007 and, thus, more recent than the previous one
(taken in Feb 2002 at the Unsteady Wind Tunnel of the Arizona State University).
</p>
<p>
I also reworked a little bit the research section and updated it with more info.

<h2>21 Nov 2005. Page moved</h2>
<p>
The webpage has been moved to http://profs.sci.univr.it/~zuccher, after some
updates.

<h2>01 Nov 2005. Affiliated to the University of Verona</h2>
<p>
From today I started a collaboration with the University of Verona, Department
of Computer Science, in order to develop a code for the numerical solution of a
generalization of Madelung fluid equations.
I will also be involved in the numerical solution of other physical problems 
governed by linear and nonlinear partial differential equations.

<h2>01 Sep 2005. Back to Italy</h2>
<p>
From September 1st I got back to Italy, after the experience at the University
of Arizona in Tucson.
</p>
<a class="top" href="#top">Top</a>

<h2>03 Jun 2005. Some scripts added</h2>
<p>
I was finally able to publish a couple of scripts,  gnuplot2ps-fig.plt and
compact-slides.sh (see the
<a href="./../programming/">programming</a> page or the direct link to 
<a href="./../programming/gnuplot2ps-fig.plt.html">gnuplot2ps-fig.plt</a>
and
<a href="./../programming/compact-slides.sh.html">compact-slides.sh</a>).
</p>
<p>
Check them out and <a href="./../">let me know</a> in case you find bugs
and/or better ways (there are many!) to write them.
</p>

<h2>01 Jun 2005. Page restyling</h2>
<p>
After some time, it is always good to change look.
I tried to conform the page to the HTML 4.01 Transitional standard and to use
the CSS style.
I was tired of color buttons everywhere.
Let's keep it simple and plain!
</p>
<p>
You might wander why my scary face appears in all the pages.
Well, after realizing that people are very surprised when they hear my voice on
the phone or when they meet me in person, I decided that the whole world should
know that I am a male and not a female.
Yes, Simone is a masculine name in Italian.
In almost all the other languages (English and French included) it is feminine.
